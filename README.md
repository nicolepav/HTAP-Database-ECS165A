**About this project:**
Completed during winter quarter 2021, this project was to create a simplified HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing) database, broken into three milestones and written in Python.



M1: Data model, bufferpool management, query interface

M2: Durability and bufferpool extension, contention-free merge, indexing

M3: Multi-statement transactions, concurrency control with 2 phase locking
